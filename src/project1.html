        Kalam’s journey to become the ‘missile man of India’ had its trials and tribulations and yet he attained his goal because of his singleminded devotion.
        After he completed his engineering, he joined DRDO’s Aeronautical Development Establishment as a scientist.
        He also designed a helicopter for the Indian Army in the beginning of his career. 
        Kalam was still not sure of his career choice. 
        In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). 
        In ISRO, he headed the project of India’s first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III). 
        The growth of Kalam began here from a mere scientist to become the missile man of India itself. 
        He headed several successful launches and started gaining recognition in relevant circles.
